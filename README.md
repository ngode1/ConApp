# ConApp
221b Con in Atlanta, GA. This is an unofficial app to replace the use of the Guidebook app. You'll find the convention schedule, a list of the speakers, information for the HLN Suite and Three Patch Suite, and a map for food and other helpful locations around the area. This app was inspired by conference-app by Lex Martinez.
